1. Install NEURON with python2.7 - see INSTALL-neuron for details

2. Get latest version of NEURON-compatible SpatialKappa:
   
   git clone https://github.com/davidcsterratt/SpatialKappa.git
   git checkout python
   
   Follow SpatialKappa install instructions, including installation of
   python interface. Make a note of the directory in which you
   installed NEURON. 
   
3. Within this KappaNEURON directory:

   python2.7 setup.py install

   You can install in a different prefix too, but then you will need
   to make sure that ${PREFIX}/lib/python2.7 is in the $PYTHONPATH
   environment variable. E.g.

   PREFIX=/home/username 
   python2.7 setup.py install --prefix=${PREFIX}
   export PYTHONPATH=${PREFIX}/lib/python2.7:$PYTHONPATH

4. Test. Note that PREFIX is the PREFIX directory in which you
   installed NEURON.

   cd test/test_ca_pulse
   ${PREFIX}/x86_64/bin/nrnivmodl
   python2.7 -i test_ca_pulse.py
   compare_traces()

   Plots should appear in which the red line (generated by the
   stochastic SimulationKappa) is close to the blue line (generated by
   a deterministic simulation).

   You may need to set the PYTHONPATH using the PREFIX where NEURON
   was installed. e.g.:

   PYTHONPATH=${PREFIX}/lib/python python2.7 -i test_ca_pulse.py
